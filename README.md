Purpose of DataScience
The purpose of datascience is to make use of data and generate inferences in order to make better informed decisions.
- The ability to take data — to be able to understand it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to communicate it — that’s going to be a hugely important skill in the next decades.”
